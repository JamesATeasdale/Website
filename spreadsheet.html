    <h1>Calorie Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, this is my calorie calculator project. One day I decided to walk to town to get a few vaccinations and it took me a whole day.
      On my way back, I started to wonder how many calories I burn every day, whether I walked or not.

      <h2>The Rundown</h2>
      <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRbnthNa1Gl3i6SwecXNq-Sw9Km2NN9DFHINZg7qZPJ1_0Pjm5p62OyV3Qv_WFoWPhyBGmBsrG-SjwF/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="565" height="250"></iframe>

        Unfortunately, the embedded spreadsheet does not allow you to input your own details, so if you want to play with it yourself, 
      I encourage you to download it <strong><a href="resources/cal_calc.ods" download="cal_calc.ods">Here.</strong></a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resources/calcalc-form.png"/>
      <p>
        On the right side, we have a form where you input your information: <strong>Weight, Height, Age and Activity.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resources/calcalc-1kg.png">
      <p>
        In the second row, you can see a list called <strong>Change(KG).</strong> This is a list of how much weight in kg you are expected to lose by following the next two columns.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resources/calcalc-1kgdaily.png">
      <p>
        For example, if you wanted to  lose 1KG a week, you would aim to eat the amount of calories on the same column under <strong>Daily(Kcal).</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resources/calcalc-1kgweekly.png">
      <p>
        The time in the next column (under <strong>Weekly(Kcal)</strong>) is how many calories you will be eating a week to lose 1KG.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resources/calcalc-zigzag.png">
      <p>
        Lastly, we have the first column (apologies for the terrible order). This is a special column that works out how many calories you should eat a day to lose 1KG. This row always equals a 1KG loss, because it was an experiment. And to make things more confusing for you!<br>

        That's about it for this small project. It isn't very well organised since it was a personal pet project that wasn't designed for public consumption, but I'm very proud at how functional it is!<br>
        I hope you are impressed with this little project. I had a lot of fun making it.
