      <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! This is the website hosted by James Teasdale on a Raspberry Pi 4.
        Currently it's quite unfinished and unscattered, but I'm having a lot of 
        fun learning about the big three (HTML, CSS, JS).

            <h2>Small fixes to UI and Cleanup</h2>
            <h5>10th Feb 2022</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg"></div>
            <p>
              The small bugs I created with my last patch have been on my mind all night. I was excited to wake up and fix them. The bugs included the video page which had its elements all over the place, the sidebar menu button not transitioning when the screen was clicked and I also took the time to remove empty items on the dropdown menu at the top. Now everything that is listed leads to somewhere. I also put underlining underneath listed elements, but I'm undecided on how to style these.

              I fixed the navigation button by deleting the JS code for the animation transition and just adding it to navigation function itself. This way, whatever triggers the side menu to open and close will also execute the animation.

              I noticed that I accidentally created a CSS rule that applies for all "<a>" and I had to fiddle about to realign the social media buttons so that they're more compact. In the future, I'll divide these "<a>"'s based on their parent elements. Having a universal CSS rule for all "<a>"'s was convenient when this website was very basic, but now that the website is becoming more complicated, I need to start organising things better. Luckily, I've done this with most other elements.

            <h5>9th Feb 2022</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg"></div>
            <p>
              I finally got around to adding a fade window when the side menu is open. 
              I created a translucent black element that covered the whole screen and set the alpha to 0.4.
              The width is set to 0%, but clicking on the button to open the side menu makes it 100% and vice versa.
              I had issues with the z-index, because I didn't realise that an element with a z-index of 3 inside an element with
              a z-index of 2 means that it's not going to draw over things with a z-index of 2. Crazy how that works.
              <br>
              I tried making it fade in and out, but the animations weren't graceful so I decided against it. Maybe I'll come back to this in the future if the transition is too jarring.
              <br>
              I spent a lot of time reorganising the elements into a better format, but the feedback page was untouched since I can't load PHP files. it looks like I screwed up the welcome message on the video page. Oops!
              <br><br>
              I changed the theme again but I'm not too happy with it. Maybe I'll never be happy with it, so I'm going to leave it alone now.

              I have successfully updated my website's design so that it looks much more appealing rather than the overly basic design it has had for a long time.
              There are many small areas of the UI that I would like to improve, but I'll make a list and come back to this at some other time.

              Today marks the day of completion for my 2D game project I created in JavaScript with a big thanks to Frank's Laboratory, who posted a video on FreeCodeCamp for people to follow.
              I ensured that I understood every single step he took and had a lot of fun doing it! I've never been one for game development, but delving into the technical side and watching my code come to life was very rewarding.
              I also took some creative liberties too, but nothing crazy. You can find more information <a href="mechAliens.html"><strong>here.</strong></a>

            <p>
              I just completed a one month intensive course in website design and development and digital It skills. All of these projects were completed with copyright law in mind.
              I learned a lot during this course:

            I'm proud of how the layout turned out for this website as it's my first attempt, but now I'm more experienced, I believe I can make this site look much more appealing.
            I need a footer with contacts.
            The site needs better colours and a more competent layout that divides elements more clearly to make them stand out more (for example, this list is hard to read).
            I also need to replace the template icon at the top right at some point.
            The <strong>PROJECTS</strong> button also leads to a page that will explain my current projects, but perhaps I should just remove it and keep it purely as a dropdown menu since the projects page itself is redundant.

          <p>
            I would like to add a fade out at the bottom for the 'result-selection' elements.
            I also want a big <strong>YOU WIN/COMPUTER WINS</strong> message to display after the scores reach a certain number.
            I managed to get the 'result-selection' objects to vanish after a score of three, so this should be easy.

            I'm pretty proud of how the video randomizer turned out, although there are currently only three videos.
            This is very easy to fix, but I'd like to revisit it when I have more ideas for the page.
            I also want the randomizer to blacklist already played videos, but maybe this will be redundant once I add the 200+ videos.

            I redesigned the buttons, but now I need to make them actually do something.
            I also need to make the questions relevant to the site or at least, interesting.

            I created a nice little text based adventure in Python, but it seems like pyscript is a headache to use.
            When I get around to this, I will have to create another from scratch in JS and create a dropdown for GAMES.

            I'm very proud of it in it's current state, although there are a couple of small things that need finishing touches.
            First is that I'd like opening the side nav to slightly darken the rest of the screen and make clicking on the page close the sidenav.
            I also need to update the placeholder logo.

            I've created a primitive chatbot in Python using a limited corpus, but I'm not sure what to do with it or how to implement it into the website.
            I want to place it into a small chat window that you can minimize similar to Facebook.
            Maybe I'll just have the chatbot talk about a random, personal interest.

            I try to keep myself up to date with any development in software, hardware and AI.
            I hope to pursue a career in software development so I can learn more and help build great projects as part of a team.
