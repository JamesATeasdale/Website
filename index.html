    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! This is the website hosted by James Teasdale on a Raspberry Pi 4.
      Currently it's quite unfinished and unscattered, but I'm having a lot of 
      fun learning about the big three (HTML, CSS, JS).

            I have successfully updated my website's design so that it looks much more appealing rather than the overly basic design it has had for a long time.
            There are many small areas of the UI that I would like to improve, but I'll make a list and come back to this at some other time.

            Today marks the day of completion for my 2D game project I created in JavaScript with a big thanks to Frank's Laboratory, who posted a video on FreeCodeCamp for people to follow.
            I ensured that I understood every single step he took and had a lot of fun doing it! I've never been one for game development, but delving into the technical side and watching my code come to life was very rewarding.
            I also took some creative liberties too, but nothing crazy. You can find more information <a href="mechAliens.html"><strong>here.</strong></a>

          <h2>Completed A Back 2 Work Month Long Bootcamp!</h2>
          <h5>22 Dec 2022</h5>
          <div class="fakeimg"></div>
          <p>
            I just completed a one month intensive course in website design and development and digital It skills. All of these projects were completed with copyright law in mind.
            I learned a lot during this course:

        <h2>Website redesign</h2>
        <h5>18th Dec 2022</h5>
        <img src="/resources/oldsite.png" style="height:200px;">
        <p>
          I'm proud of how the layout turned out for this website as it's my first attempt, but now I'm more experienced, I believe I can make this site look much more appealing.
          I need a footer with contacts.
          The site needs better colours and a more competent layout that divides elements more clearly to make them stand out more (for example, this list is hard to read).
          I also need to replace the template icon at the top right at some point.
          The <strong>PROJECTS</strong> button also leads to a page that will explain my current projects, but perhaps I should just remove it and keep it purely as a dropdown menu since the projects page itself is redundant.

        <h2>Finish the RPS game</h2>
        <h5>12th Nov 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg"></div>
        <p>
          I would like to add a fade out at the bottom for the 'result-selection' elements.
          I also want a big <strong>YOU WIN/COMPUTER WINS</strong> message to display after the scores reach a certain number.
          I managed to get the 'result-selection' objects to vanish after a score of three, so this should be easy.

        <h2>Add more videos</h2>
        <h5>5th Nov 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg"></div>
        <p>
          I'm pretty proud of how the video randomizer turned out, although there are currently only three videos.
          This is very easy to fix, but I'd like to revisit it when I have more ideas for the page.
          I also want the randomizer to blacklist already played videos, but maybe this will be redundant once I add the 200+ videos.

        <h5>1st Nov 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg"></div>
        <p>
          I redesigned the buttons, but now I need to make them actually do something.
          I also need to make the questions relevant to the site or at least, interesting.

        <h2>Create a text based adventure game</h2>
        <h5>29th Oct 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg"></div>
        <p>
          I created a nice little text based adventure in Python, but it seems like pyscript is a headache to use.
          When I get around to this, I will have to create another from scratch in JS and create a dropdown for GAMES.

        <h2>Side Nav</h2>
        <h5>22nd Oct 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg"></div>
        <p>
          I'm very proud of it in it's current state, although there are a couple of small things that need finishing touches.
          First is that I'd like opening the side nav to slightly darken the rest of the screen and make clicking on the page close the sidenav.
          I also need to update the placeholder logo.

        <h2>Chatbot</h2>
        <h5>12th Nov 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg"></div>
        <p>
          I've created a primitive chatbot in Python using a limited corpus, but I'm not sure what to do with it or how to implement it into the website.
          I want to place it into a small chat window that you can minimize similar to Facebook.
          Maybe I'll just have the chatbot talk about a random, personal interest.

          I have been a technology enthusiest for many years. 
          I try to keep myself up to date with any development in software, hardware in AI.
          I hope to pursue a career in software development so I can learn more and help build great projects as part of a team.
